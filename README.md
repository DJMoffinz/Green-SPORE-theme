# Green SPORE theme
This is a custom theme for Windows that adds a custom cursor group and a sick wallpaper. It also changes the Windows colours and enables dark mode. 
This is my forst foray into Windows theme development, and I will hopefully improve as I continue working on this.

Also, use these settings:

Alternatively, check the [Releases](https://github.com/DJMoffinz/Green-SPORE-theme/releases) page for a pre-packed file.
